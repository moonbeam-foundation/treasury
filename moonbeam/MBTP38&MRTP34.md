RadiumBlock RPC and Bootnode Services for Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase-alpha for Q4 2024/Q1 2025

**Abstract**  -  [RadiumBlock  1](https://www.radiumblock.com/)’s proposal seeks funding to provide high-performance RPC endpoints and bootnodes for the Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase-alpha networks for Q4 2024 and Q1 2025. RadiumBlock will deliver enterprise-grade infrastructure, supporting essential RPC methods, guaranteeing adherence to Moonbeam’s Code of Conduct, and ensuring fast, reliable, and scalable access for developers.

**Motivation**  - The Moonbeam Community, via the Treasury Council, should support this proposal to enhance the stability and growth of the Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase-alpha ecosystems. RadiumBlock’s services reduce the complexity of infrastructure management, allowing developers to focus on innovation. Additionally, providing blockchain snapshots  _(which we will set up within 30 days of proposal approval)_  will enable developers to quickly and efficiently access specific points in the network’s state, reducing synchronization time and further accelerating development. We believe this proposal will contribute to the long-term success and sustainability of the entire ecosystem by ensuring reliable, scalable infrastructure and enhanced developer tools.

**Project Overview and Team Experience**  - RadiumBlock, owned by RealWeb LLC, brings extensive experience in AWS infrastructure management and blockchain services. Since 2021, RadiumBlock has been an active and known participant in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem, participating in the Polkadot and Kusama Thousand Validator Program and offering validator services to several other chains. As active infrastructure provider in the DotSama ecosystem, RadiumBlock delivers RPC endpoints to over  [20 networks](https://radiumblock.com/supported-networks.html). The team’s proven track record includes providing  [essential snapshot services  1](https://radiumblock.com/snapshots.html)  and demonstrating capability to handle complex blockchain infrastructure needs.

For this proposal, RadiumBlock will deploy and maintain RPC endpoints and bootnodes for Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase-aplha ensuring near-100% uptime, scalability, and security. Leveraging a hybrid-model infrastructure (more on this in the  [full proposal  10](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1umspoMkWUSm03lyigVcxO_mGjCbdt6nLidE4R4iKbwk/edit?usp=sharing)) that combines on-premise bare-metal servers with cloud resources, RadiumBlock can effectively manage traffic surges and ensure low latency. This model also provides flexibility in deployment options (OnPrem, Cloud, or Hybrid), ensuring that the infrastructure remains robust and adaptable to varying demands. Additionally, we will also deploy Snapshots for Moonbeam and Moonriver within 30 days of approval of the proposal.

RadiumBlock’s infrastructure is designed with security as a top priority, implementing advanced encryption protocols, continuous monitoring, and automated failover mechanisms to protect the network and maintain service continuity. Additionally, the strategically located nodes and advanced load-balancing techniques contribute to exceptional speed and performance, ensuring that developers on the Moonbeam network can rely on fast, responsive, and secure access to the blockchain. With 24/7 technical support and a global presence, RadiumBlock is well-equipped to support the Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase-alpha ecosystems, enabling them to scale and thrive.

**Network Usage and Performance Statistics**  
To provide a clearer and more detailed understanding of the impact of RadiumBlock’s services on the Moonbeam and Moonriver networks, we have compiled key usage statistics (May 31 - August 28, 2024; 90 days):

-   Total Requests Served (Moonbeam + Moonriver): 8,209,772,365  
    Average Daily Requests on Moonbeam: 44,043,403.52  
    Average Daily Requests on Moonriver: 47,176,289.42  
    Peak Daily Requests on Moonbeam: 241,231,861  
    Peak Daily Requests on Moonriver: 612,830,371  
    Regions Covered: Europe, Asia, North America, Australia, South America, Africa

A more detailed breakdown of the usage statistics and requests across regions is provided in the  [full proposal  10](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1umspoMkWUSm03lyigVcxO_mGjCbdt6nLidE4R4iKbwk/edit?usp=sharing).

**Rationale**  - RadiumBlock’s proposal ensures that the Moonbeam Ecosystem has the reliable, scalable infrastructure needed to support its growth. By providing fast and secure  _RPC endpoints, bootnodes, and snapshots_, developers can build and deploy dApps more efficiently, while users benefit from improved speed, performance, and reliability.

**Overall Cost**  - The total cost for providing RPC endpoints and bootnodes for the Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase-alpha networks during Q4 2024 and Q1 2025 is $15,600. The breakdown is as follows:

-   Total Monthly Cost: $2,600
-   Total Cost for Q4 2024 and Q1 2025: $15,600
-   Cost Distribution:
-   60% allocated to Moonbeam (GLMR): $9,360 / 55,747.68 GLMR
-   40% allocated to Moonriver (MOVR): $6,240 / 704.11 MOVR

**Use of Treasury Funds**  - The requested treasury funds of $15,600 will be used primarily to cover the infrastructure costs associated with providing and maintaining high-performance RPC endpoints and bootnodes for the Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase-alpha networks during Q4 2024 and Q1 2025. This is all inclusive of operating and administrative expenses for server operations, our team’s ongoing support, monitoring, and security measures to ensure the network’s reliability, scalability, and security.

**Milestones:**

-   RPC Endpoints: already running for Moonbeam and Moonriver, will set up for Moonbase-alpha once the proposal is approved
-   Bootnodes: will set up for Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase-alpha once the proposal is approved
-   Snapshots: will be set up within 30 days once the proposal is approved (this does not incur additional cost)
