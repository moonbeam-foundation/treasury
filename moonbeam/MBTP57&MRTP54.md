**Title**  
OnFinality’s Proposal for High Performance RPC & Bootnode for Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase Alpha in Q4 2025/Q1 2026

**Abstract**  
OnFinality kindly requests support from the Moonbeam Treasury so that we can continue to run the Moonbeam Community’s preferred RPC services

**Motivation**  
[OnFinality](https://onfinality.io/en)  has a proven track record providing RPC API support for the Moonbeam networks since January 2021 and plans to continue the long standing partnership of a reliable top-tier API service

-   At the time of our last submission, provider usage data showed that OnFinality’s Moonbeam RPC is the community’s preferred choice - a clear testament to our high standards in service and support.
    
-   Since then, we have seen a further 2x Growth in requests across our Moonbeam family of RPC endpoints
    
-   OnFinality is the only Moonbeam RPC service provider to guarantee high availability and low latency with financial penalties if service level targets are not met
    
-   We have further optimised our Moonbeam services for cost thanks to the treasury’s feedback on our previous proposal

**Rationale**

Setting up reliable and scalable RPC infrastructure is difficult and expensive:

-   It requires a level of server development expertise that many do not have. Running production level infrastructure is especially tricky. You need to autoscale quickly to handle bursty traffic, and you want to provide services in different regions around the world to provide low latency services — all of this is incredibly costly.
-   Asking others to run their own node hurts your ability to onboard developers into your ecosystem and serves as a massive barrier to entry. It’s costly to run a full node nearly continuously, especially when your dApp’s traffic is low and inconsistent.
-   Running nodes and performing the related DevOps activities requires constant attention - time that would be better spent elsewhere building.

OnFinality’s Ultimate API service mitigates these barriers of entry. Users in your ecosystem can enjoy the ultimate reliable API endpoint that can power their app as it grows.

**Key Terms**

Our services include:

-   99.9% Service Availability Level (SLA) with financial penalties
-   Externally monitored 99th Percentile latency of under 1 second with financial penalties
-   Complete Archive history
-   Support for Trace and Debug methods
-   Support for eth_getLogs RPC method
-   24/7 Monitoring and on-call engineers operating
-   Community support via our telegram channel and  [Support Centre](https://support.onfinality.io/)
-   [Rate Limits](https://documentation.onfinality.io/support/public-rate-limits)  ensure fair usage of shared public RPC services. Public access to our Moonbean, Moonriver, and Moonbase Alpha endpoints will be provided at 50 responses / second, per IP
    -   Public access at 50 requests / second
    -   Free private API access at 50 requests / second via the OnFinality portal with usage and performance insights. Up to 500,000 requests per day.
    -   Higher access levels available for users on our  [Growth and Ultimate plans](https://onfinality.io/pricing)
-   Self Service Dedicated Node provisioning on OnFinality Cloud
-   One free bootnode per network
