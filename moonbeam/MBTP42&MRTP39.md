Moonbeam RPC Services Submission Q4 2024 and Q1 2025

Abstract - In the most recent 3 months we served more than a billion requests. Dwellir got selected as one of the providers to provide public RPC services for the community for Q2 & Q3 this year. We hope with this proposal that we can continue to provide RPC services to the community for the next six months.

Motivation - The Dwellir mission is to serve developers worldwide with instant data access and a comprehensive suite of tools so that they can build web3 applications.

Project Overview and Team Experience - We currently run RPC services for Moonbeam, Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha and more than 100 other blockchain networks. Currently, we are processing 1.4 billion requests per day on average and you will see throughout this proposal that our experience within the Moonbeam ecosystem is extensive.

One of the key differentiators with Dwellir is that we own and operate our own bare metal machines which have several important effects.

Performance: Bare metal servers offer superior performance and low-latency communication, essential for decentralized networks to efficiently process transactions and reach consensus.

Security: Bare metal servers provide enhanced security and isolation, safeguarding sensitive data and assets in a decentralized network.

Control: With bare metal servers, node operators have full control over hardware and software configurations, ensuring adherence to network rules and consensus mechanisms.

Reliability: Bare metal servers offer robustness and stability, making them reliable choices for continuous operation in decentralized networks.

Expertise: Our team has a proven track record of creating tailor-made blockchain infrastructure that align with the Moonbeam community’s specific needs.

Support: We don’t just build and leave – our team stands by the community for the long haul. We engage with ongoing support, maintenance, and optimization services to keep the networks running smoothly and efficiently.

Rationale - A service like Dwellir’s ensures that developers can build without the overheads and costs of managing enterprise infrastructure. Furthermore, users of wallets and dapps can have a smooth experience with RPCs that deliver fast data reliably.

Overall Cost - Based on our current cost measurements across Moonbeam, Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha nodes.

Total monthly cost = $3,055.5 per month  
Total Q4 2024/Q1 2025 cost = $18,333

This includes multiple sites in Sweden and extended access in Tunisia. We’re also opening datacenters in Singapore and we would be default host services there at no extra cost under this current proposal.

Splitting by 60% GLMR and 40% MOVR

GLMR : 62726  
MOVR: 776

Use of Treasury Funds - To cover the costs of hardware operation and maintenance. We own and operate our own bare metal services in 4 locations.

Specifications - Dwellir will provide archival publicly available RPC nodes.

-   HTTPS and Websockets APIs for Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase alpha
-   24/7 monitoring and upgrade notifications
-   Public API’s are subject to a rate limit of 30 API Calls/second
-   Support for Debug and Trace methods
-   Support for eth_getLogs RPC method
-   Enterprise level security as standard

**Update**  
_Clarification on Pricing:_  We have applied the same pricing formula in this proposal as we did in the  [previous one](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-mr22-mb26-dwellir-q2-q3-2024-rpc-services/1603/13), which is based on hardware usage and bandwidth. Due to a significant increase in the storage consumption of these nodes, the associated costs have risen accordingly. In the  [full proposal](https://nextcloud.dwellir.com/s/JgJZPmHPNow4Pc5)  one can read the information about hardware consumption from the  **Pricing Table Quote**. To reduce the cost in this proposal we decreased the overhead charge from 20% to 5%, compared to the previous proposal.

It would not be honest to add a discount on the proposal after it has already been published, when others have published their proposals. We keep our proposal as it is.

/Gustav - Dwellir

Dear  [@gustavnipe](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/gustavnipe)  ,

The  [@TreasuryCouncil](https://forum.moonbeam.network/groups/treasurycouncil)  would like to thank you for submitting the above RPC service proposal!

I am starting here a round of questions / feedback, other Treasury members could join afterwards.

With reference to your proposal my question is specifically about this point you reported in the proposal:

“ Support: We don’t just build and leave – our team stands by the community for the long haul. We engage with ongoing support, maintenance, and optimization services to keep the networks running smoothly and efficiently."

Can you kindly better describe on which communication channels are you available on daily basis for any community member looking for help about your services? This is just for confirmation/visibility, we already know your dedication to community and appreciate it.

To stay on schedule we’d appreciate a reply in a timely manner, ideally by next Monday, September 9th.

Thanks & kind regards  
Michele

Thanks for your question Michele,

We are available in the public Moonbeam Discord server to respond to any feedback and helping out with potential troubleshooting-questions from members in the ecosystem.

To stay on top of any new releases for the Moonbeam chains, we have built a bot that monitors the GitHub-repository for any updates.

Best regards,

Hey  [@gustavnipe](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/gustavnipe)

Thanks again for your proposal!  
We highly appreciate the operation of bootnodes at no extra cost and value pretty much all the technical aspects outlined in your  [document](https://nextcloud.dwellir.com/s/JgJZPmHPNow4Pc5)  as well as the high reputation Dwellir has among us.

However, there’s one bummer in the proposal that is somewhat hard to make sense of for the Council which is the doubling in asking price compared to half a year ago while using the same price formula due to an increase in storage.  
Could you elaborate how that came to be and how a) NVMe storage (usage only that is) is such an excessive price factor in the overall service provisioning and / or b) how storage has increased so very significantly compared to half a year ago that causes a doubling in the total asking price.

As we are on a tight schedule now, let me add here — If you see any possibility of going back to last terms pricing & service offer that would be fantastic!  
Thanks a lot!

Hi,

Thank you for following up with us.

We also noticed that the NVMe storage consumption has increased significantly compared to six months ago. It’s possible that something within the specific containers running these nodes has caused this increase. We will look into this further.

However, since we are unable to provide a detailed explanation at this time, and given your tight schedule, I am updating our quote to reflect our previous pricing:

-   **Total monthly cost**: $1,542.52
-   **Total Q4 2024/Q1 2025 cost**: $9,255.14

Please consider this as our official proposal.

Best regards,  
Gustav  
Dwellir

Hi  [@gustavnipe](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/gustavnipe)  , the Treasury Council has carefully reviewed your proposal, and considering your key strengths in decentralization, latency, and cost/quality balance, we are pleased to inform you that you are among the three RPC providers selected for Q4 2024 / Q1 2025. This post serves as your first Support Signal, with two more to follow soon. Additionally, the 30-day moving average price information will be provided to help you create your on-chain proposal.  
Your proposal stood out as the most cost-effective option, with a reasonably strong track record of service and participation in the ecosystem. Your offering is complete, including bootnodes, eth.getLogs, and trace+API. The only area for potential improvement noted was the limited geographic coverage. We are glad to have you onboard!

Thanks for the information.

We are happy to hear that our services are appreciated.

We will be working on the increased geographic coverage in the coming months, with the aim to provide a stronger offer next time.

Hi again  [@micheleicebergnodes](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/micheleicebergnodes),

We have now filed one on-chain treasury proposal for Moonbeam and one for Moonriver. Both on-chain submissions are for Q4 2024. We have used the 30dma information that you shared last week.

Here are the links to the submissions:

-   [MB treasury proposal for Q4 2024](https://moonbeam.polkassembly.network/treasury/37)
-   [MR treasury proposal for Q4 2024](https://moonriver.polkassembly.network/treasury/33)

Please let us know if we should do anything more.

Hey  [@gustavnipe](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/gustavnipe),  
let me quickly jump in here. You are referring to Dwellir’s Moonriver proposal. If you check onchain ‘p.js (Moonriver) > governance > treasury’ you can see that the proposal has already been approved and the payout will be triggered at the end of the current 6d spend period which is in T - 1d 14h.  
Feel free to always reach out anything more comes up, we’re here to help!  ![:sparkles:](https://forum.moonbeam.network/images/emoji/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12 ":sparkles:")![:heart:](https://forum.moonbeam.network/images/emoji/twitter/heart.png?v=12 ":heart:")

Hi  [@_yrn](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/_yrn)

Thanks for your reply. I saw it now when I used ‘p.js(Moonriver)’. When I check via Polkassembly, I couldn’t see it. I guess the Gov1 Treasury-interface is deprecated at Polkassemlby.

Thank you.

Dear  [@gustavnipe](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/gustavnipe),

Please proceed with submitting your Treasury Proposal for the RPC services Q1 2025 payout on-chain. As before, please split the agreed quarterly cost in a 60/40 ratio between GLMR and MOVR using the EMA30 prices below.

GLMR: $ 0.265  
MOVR: $ 13.716

As per today’s Subscan data (provided by Coingecko) for  [MOVR](https://moonriver.subscan.io/tools/price_converter?value=1&type=time&from=MOVR&to=USD&time=1736463600)  and  
[GLMR](https://moonbeam.subscan.io/tools/price_converter?value=1&type=time&from=GLMR&to=USD&time=1736463600).

Once on-chain, we will make sure the Proposal is converted to a Council Motion and payed out asap.

Thank you so much!  
Yaron

Hi Dwellir Team ([@gustavnipe](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/gustavnipe)),

when you posted the root track gov motion to do the treasury.spendLocal i realized that the ability to propose spendings on the treasury pallet was removed  ![:see_no_evil:](https://forum.moonbeam.network/images/emoji/twitter/see_no_evil.png?v=12 ":see_no_evil:")

I suspect that was unintended and notified the Moonbeam team.

It should still go through the treasury pallet and the council shall transfer it into a treasuryCouncilMotion.

Your root track ref would also require a 2m GLMR decisionDeposit so that one might just be left to die (expiring).

Sorry for the inconvenience. If your submission deposit gets slashed you can for sure request that as reimbursement along with the actual treasury proposal later on.

We’ll keep you update  ![:pray:](https://forum.moonbeam.network/images/emoji/twitter/pray.png?v=12 ":pray:")

Thanks for getting back to us. Yes, we couldn’t use the normal way of filing a treasury proposal so we tried with via Open Gov.

Anyway, we will be on standby until we hear that the bug has been resolved.  ![:slightly_smiling_face:](https://forum.moonbeam.network/images/emoji/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=12 ":slightly_smiling_face:")

We’ve captured the EMA30 price for MOVR at $ 8.483093 at block  [10380992](https://moonriver.subscan.io/tools/price_converter?value=1&type=block&from=MOVR&to=USD&time=10380992)  and at $ 0.150840 at  [9673865](https://moonbeam.subscan.io/tools/price_converter?value=1&type=block&from=GLMR&to=USD&time=9673865)  for GLMR.

This will result in a total payout of 36,814.32 GLMR and 436.40 MOVR to settle your request of $ 9,255.12.

Again, thanks you for your patience!
