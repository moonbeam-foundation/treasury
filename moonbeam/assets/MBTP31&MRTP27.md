Title - [Proposal: 31] [Idea] Delegate dashboard renewal for Moonbeam, Moonriver and Moonbase

Abstract

Karma has built and has been maintaining custom delegate dashboards for Moonbeam, Moonriver and Moonbase over the past year. This proposal is a request for funding to continue enhancing and maintaining these dashboards.

Motivation
To build a healthy and dynamic ecosystem, a DAO needs active contributors. It is in the best interest of the DAO to recognize the most active contributors, engage them and potentially reward them for their contributions. Having a contributor tracking system will encourage members to lead various initiatives and contribute. By having visibility into the contributions, DAO can encourage the right kind of behavior from their community.

Project Overview and Team Experience
The delegate dashboards we have built are used by the DAO and community to onboard delegates, delegate their tokens, get visibility into their activities, hold them accountable, improve voting participation and further decentralize the DAO. The dashboard also provides deep insights into each delegate’s governance activity that will help token holders decide who to delegate their tokens to.
Note: Moonbase is not actively used but it acts as a sandbox to test any contract changes before deploying to other networks.

Team: I am the founder of Karma 1, have been in the crypto space for over 8 years and have been working on Karma for last 2.5 years. We are team of 5 mostly devs.

Rationale
Our dashboards are being actively used by Moonbeam community to perform delegation and gain visibility into delegate activity. Some of the features that are actively used include:
Features of the custom dashboard include:

Delegate onboarding flow
Ability to link social handles (Forum, Discord Handle)
Update delegation pitch and interests
Display Voting stats, history and voting reasons for each proposal
Display Forum stats
Contribution Scores
Ability for token holders to delegate directly from the dashboard
In Depth insights about delegates
Auto tag inactive delegates
Overall Cost
We are requesting 55,865 GLMR ($10k) for Moonbeam and 1094 MOVR (~$10k) for Moonriver and Moonbase dashboards.

Use of Treasury Funds
The funds will be used for the following:

Infrastructure costs: This includes the cost to maintain servers and third party indexers used to index delegates on a daily basis, store and calculate various stats.
Maintenance and Support: We received support requests on a regular basis and we help tokenholders resolve the issues in timely fashion. Like with any software, there is maintenance tasks related to upgrading libraries, bug fixes, performance enhancements, changes caused by third party services/indexer and small changes (branding upgrade for example).
Enhancements: We are constantly add features to the overall product and those updates are pushed to these three dashboards automatically.
We will maintain the dashboard for one year from the date of approval of proposal.
