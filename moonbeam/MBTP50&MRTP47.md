**Subscan Funding Proposal for Subscan Explorer Operations on Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase Networks – 2024**

----------

### [](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/subscan-funding-proposal-for-subscan-explorer-operations-on-moonbeam-moonriver-and-moonbase-networks-2024/2072#p-7109-short-description-1)Short Description

We are pleased to submit this proposal to the Moonbeam and Moonriver communities, requesting treasury support for operating and maintaining Subscan Explorer on  **Moonbeam**,  **Moonriver**, and  **Moonbase**  in 2024. Subscan provides essential chain indexing, real-time monitoring, and a dedicated technical support framework.

Throughout the past year, we introduced key enhancements—such as  **NFT support (ERC-721, ERC-1155)**,  **contract verification**,  **staking/governance integrations**, and a  **portfolio feature**  inspired by DeBank. Additionally, Subscan continues offering  **free APIs**  that help developers and community projects build on our data, fostering broader ecosystem innovation. All these improvements are part of our comprehensive monthly service.

Subscan Explorer is a reliable, user-friendly platform that empowers the Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase communities with:

-   **Accurate On-Chain Data**: Indexed data for transactions, staking, governance, and NFTs.
-   **Timely Technical Support**: Rapid issue resolution and guidance on network updates.
-   **Network Monitoring**: Continuous oversight to maintain optimal performance.
-   **Free Community APIs**: Open access to our indexed data, encouraging new tools, dashboards, and applications.

With this proposal, we aim to ensure seamless operations for the coming year. While the requested funds reflect the scale of services needed for three networks over twelve months, we trust the community recognizes the wide-ranging benefits Subscan provides. Moving forward, we also plan to transition to  **quarterly**  reimbursement requests to provide more frequent updates on our progress and costs.

Subscan helps developers, validators, and end-users navigate the complex functionalities of Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase. By supporting our continued operations, the community can benefit from:

-   **EVM Feature Expansion**: Ongoing integration of NFTs, contract verification, and cross-chain functionalities.
-   **Reliable Governance and Staking Data**: Quick access to essential metrics, fostering transparency and trust.
-   **A Full-Stack Experience**: Progress toward an integrated  **EVM + Substrate**  platform, streamlining the user journey.
-   **Free APIs for the Community**: Enabling projects and builders to innovate with easily accessible on-chain data.

Hello  [@yakioliu](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/yakioliu)

your last funding request for 2022 and 2023 came in very late.

When evaluating that proposal in summer 2024 the treasury council asked you to submit future funding proposals in a timely manner - especially requesting the 2024 proposal end of year and consecutive proposals semi-annualy directly after each half year (  [[Proposal: MB 28/29 & MR 24/25] for Funding Subscan Explorer Operations and Maintenance on Moonbeam and Moonbase Networks for 2022 and 2023 - #7 by dev0_sik](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-mb-28-29-mr-24-25-for-funding-subscan-explorer-operations-and-maintenance-on-moonbeam-and-moonbase-networks-for-2022-and-2023/1780/7)  ).

Now we’re ihaving the same situation again, receiving the request 4 months late.  
This delay leads to the treasury spending roughly 2.5 times the amount of tokens.

I hereby set definitive dates for future proposals.  
The treasury council will reject any funding proposals submitted after the respective deadlines passed.  
H1 2025 (January - June 2025): Deadline 2025/07/31  
H2 2025 (July - December 2025): Deadline 2026/01/31

The respective dates refer to posting the requests here on the forum.

In case you have not been following closely there is a new spending flow in place which no longer requires you to submit the proposal on chain.  
Therefore the treasury council asks you to provide a MOVR reicever address and a GLMR receiver address to be able to process your funding proposal.

Please provide these addresses no later than on 20th of May.

Hello  [@dev0_sik](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/dev0_sik)  and Moonbeam Community,

Thank you very much for the reminder and for clearly setting the expectations and deadlines going forward.

We sincerely acknowledge the issue with the timing of our recent submissions. You’re absolutely right — our previous proposals were delayed. We take full responsibility for this and truly appreciate the council’s patience.

For the current request, our initial intention was to submit in Q1 2025. However, with the major changes in the treasury process underway at that time, we were concerned about potential issues arising from submitting during the transition period. That led us to hold off — unfortunately longer than we should have. This was a misjudgment on our part, and we apologize for the resulting impact on the treasury and council.

We will strictly adhere to the new deadlines you’ve outlined, and will make sure our future proposals are submitted on time.

Regarding the receiver address, it was already included in the proposal:  
Beneficiary: 0x9c0fEf6b48Cb0B16EDc72a61d9503A78782c19e2

If there’s anything else required from our side, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

With the question regarding the beneficiary I just wanted to double-check that it’s the receiver for both assets on both chains but I see there is your identity set in either environment.

Thanks a lot.

Dear Moonbeam/Moonriver Community,

To enhance our security protocols and align with updated safety measures, we’ll be updating the beneficiary address to:

New Address:  
0x4C1d278B4be149D053ECc9dDd4a0f803779962d1

Key details:  
![:white_check_mark:](https://forum.moonbeam.network/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:")  This new address has already been verified with an on-chain identity linked to the original account.  
![:white_check_mark:](https://forum.moonbeam.network/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:")  All future transactions will use this updated address.  
![:white_check_mark:](https://forum.moonbeam.network/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:")  This new address is available on both Moonbeam and Moonriver.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this transition may cause. Your understanding and cooperation are greatly appreciated as we prioritize the security of our operations.

Should you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us.

Heyy  [@yakioliu](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/yakioliu)

both treasury proposals are have been put on-chain on Moonbeam and Moonriver, votend on by the Treasury Council and are now closed. Expect the payout to be triggered at the end of each networks current spend period.

We’ve captured 30d EMA prices at $  [$0.086794](https://moonbeam.subscan.io/tools/price_converter?value=1&type=block&from=GLMR&to=USD&time=%2011271177)  for GLMR at block  [2011271177](https://moonbeam.subscan.io/block/10255927)  and $ 6.904588 for MOVR at block  [11950492](https://moonriver.subscan.io/block/11950492).  
As with previous funding, the total funding of $ 93,359.2 (for all of 2024) was divided among GLMR and MOVR tokens in a 60:40 ratio. This will result in a payout of 645,384.70 GLMR and 5,408.53 MOVR.

As mentioned in this thread previously, future Subscan Treasury Proposals shall be submitted on a biannual (6 months) funding basis with the submission deadlines stated above.

Thank you! We greatly value your contributions to the ecosystem!  ![:heart_hands:](https://forum.moonbeam.network/images/emoji/twitter/heart_hands.png?v=12 ":heart_hands:")

Hey  [@_yrn](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/_yrn)  [@Michele_Amurri](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/michele_amurri)  [@dev0_sik](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/dev0_sik)  and Moonbeam Treasury Council , thanks so much for the clear update — really appreciate the Treasury Council’s support and coordination  ![:raised_hands:](https://forum.moonbeam.network/images/emoji/twitter/raised_hands.png?v=12 ":raised_hands:")

We’ll make sure to submit the next proposals on time and continue delivering high-quality services for the Moonbeam and Moonriver ecosystems.

During this round, we noticed a new runtime update to  `treasury_spend`  on Moonbeam — we’re already working on integrating it to ensure Subscan continues providing the most complete and accurate information possible.

Also, while going through the process, we realized that forum discussions aren’t currently connected to onchain proposals within Subscan. That makes it tricky for users to get the full context behind each proposal. We’ll explore how to improve this — potentially in collaboration with the Moonbeam team — to give users a more seamless experience.

If anyone in the community has thoughts or suggestions around this, we’d love to hear from you! And of course, if there’s anything else you think we can improve, feel free to reach out.

All of these efforts are included in Subscan’s monthly service package — no extra cost involved  ![:blue_heart:](https://forum.moonbeam.network/images/emoji/twitter/blue_heart.png?v=12 ":blue_heart:")

Thanks again for the trust and support!

— the Subscan Team
