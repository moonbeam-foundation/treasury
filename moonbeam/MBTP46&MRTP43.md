Abstract

This proposal seeks funding from the Moonbeam Treasury to integrate Cookbook.dev’s AI developer assistant agent into the Moonbeam Developer Documentation. The AI agent will provide real-time, contextual support to developers, enhancing their experience and accelerating development on the Moonbeam network. The onboarding system includes a “Chain Info” tab containing outlinks to everything relevant for builders on Moonbeam as well as a code playground environment featuring Cookbook.dev’s entire Solidity smart contract template library featuring over 1900 contract templates for tokens, NFTs, DEXs, DAOs and more, available alongside the AI assistant This initiative aligns with Moonbeam’s mission of fostering a robust and accessible developer ecosystem.

Motivation

The Moonbeam developer community is rapidly growing, and with it, the demand for quick and efficient access to accurate documentation and support. While the existing documentation is extensive, developers often face challenges in navigating and extracting relevant information. Cookbook.dev’s AI assistant and onboarding workflow integrated into the documentation will:

- Reduce the “time to hello world” down to seconds or minutes for developers on Moonbeam with the code playground and smart contract templates.
- Improve developer efficiency by providing instant, accurate responses to common and complex queries.
- Reduce developer friction by minimizing the time spent searching for information.
- Enhance engagement and retention by making the developer experience more interactive and intuitive.
- Scale support without requiring constant human intervention, allowing community and core contributors to focus on higher-value initiatives.

Project Overview and Team Experience

Cookbook.dev is a San-Francisco based blockchain and AI startup supporting the Cookbook.dev Onboard suite for over 60 blockchain protocols. Our team is mostly made up of solidity engineers who deeply understand and empathize with the challenges faced by developers in the blockchain industry.

Rational

By providing an intuitive, battle-tested path for developers to begin learning and building on Moonbeam through Cookbook.dev’s AI assistant and code playground, we pave the way for more Dapps on the network that ultimately contribute to TVL, Fees, and value accruing to the Moonbeam token.

Overall Cost

The overall cost is $7,000 USD in Moonbeam tokens for 1 year of service for the AI assistant, the code playground environment with smart contract templates and the Chain info tab along with access to the admin panel for the Moonbeam team.

Use of Treasury Funds

The treasury funds will be used for:

- The initial setup and integration of the AI assistant, code playground and chain info tab.
- Ongoing hosting and maintenance costs.
- Technical support and monitoring to ensure optimal performance.

Specifications

The integration will be completed via an open source contribution by the Cookbook.dev team into the Moonbeam docs repo on github. Once reviewed and merged, the integration will be complete, live and active, with the Moonbeam team managing the tool through an admin panel provided by the Cookbook.dev team.

Expected Impact

- Faster onboarding for new developers.
- Increased adoption and development activity on Moonbeam.
- Reduction in support overhead for community managers and core contributors.
- Improved accessibility of Moonbeam documentation for a global audience.

We worked with the Cookbook folks to do a test integration of Cookbook to the Moonbeam Docs, and it works great.

Also, the network information tab is super helpful, and you can even deploy basic template contracts with just a few clicks.

Although we love Kapa.ai, Cookbook provides a product that adapts better to Web3 in general.

AI is always best when it’s trained for something specific, and i love using it to help the Moonbeam community find the right answers. but cookbook.dev takes it up a notch - seems even more advanced, giving devs and users real-time support + a full playground to build faster = FULLY support this proposal

Hey [@Michael_Dankanich](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/michael_dankanich) thanks for putting up this proposal!

I really like what I’ve read and what I was shown.

Quick question:

- The proposal mentions Moonbeam only, with Moonbase Alpha also showing up on your website. Would this proposal possibly include a Moonriver integration as well? Moonriver is an integral part of the Moonbeam ecosystem.

Speaking of Moonriver, the [@TreasuryCouncil](https://forum.moonbeam.network/groups/treasurycouncil) usually handles funding proposals with payouts in GLMR and MOVR tokens proportionally to a 60:40 ratio. Just making sure that’d be fine for you.  
Thanks!

Hey!

To give some clarity. This integration is not really “on-chain”, so the fact that they show Moonbeam and Moonbase Alpha is because their stack supports 1 Mainnet and 1 Testnet. But if you ask a question about Moonriver, it should provide correct info because it is gathering it from the same resources that include Moonriver.

This is a replacement of what we had before (Kapa), and they agreed to move forward with Treasury funding ![:smiley:](https://forum.moonbeam.network/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=12 ":smiley:")

Hi [@_yrn](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/_yrn) glad to hear you like the proposal. Thanks for checking it out.

This proposal would cover Moonbeam only. Supporting Moonriver in the same way would fall under a separate proposal and separate panel.

The payout ratio will work, appreciate you highlighting that.

Hi [@Michael_Dankanich](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/michael_dankanich) the Treasury Council has decided to fund your proposal ![:dizzy:](https://forum.moonbeam.network/images/emoji/twitter/dizzy.png?v=12 ":dizzy:")

Please provide us with a beneficiary address for Moonbeam / Moonriver to receive the funding.  
We’ve captured 30d EMA prices at $ 0.116199 for GLMR at block [10001400](https://moonbeam.subscan.io/block/10001400) and $ 7.191372 for MOVR at block [10707430](https://moonriver.subscan.io/block/10707430). This will result in a payout of 36,144.89 GLMR and 389.36 MOVR.

Thank you so much!
