Hey  [@micheleicebergnodes](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/micheleicebergnodes)  , team,

Months: January, February, March  
at EUR 400 per month, + EUR 50 safety margin  
Total EUR 1,350.00

This covers the infra costs for both  [stakeglmr.com](http://stakeglmr.com/)  and  [stakemovr.com](http://stakemovr.com/)  (with many thanks from Hetzner)

For beneficiary you can use Stakebaby collator addresses, and split the amount as you see fit or sent it over one network only. It’s the same for me.

Hey  [@stakebaby](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/stakebaby)

Your total of EUR 1,350.00 was converted using an EUR:USD rate of 1.081952 (provided by Google Finance yesterday) to USD 1,460.63.

That total will be divided between GLMR and MOVR tokens in a 60:40 ratio.  
We’ve captured 30d EMA prices at $ 0.093379 for GLMR at block  [10255927](https://moonbeam.subscan.io/block/10255927)  and $ 6.200665 for MOVR at block  [10959245](https://moonriver.subscan.io/block/10959245). This will result in a payout of 9,385.21 GLMR and 94.22 MOVR.

Proposals were put on-chain & approved by the Treasury Council, already.  
The funding amounts will be transferred to your submitted beneficiary addresses at the end of each network’s 6-day treasury spend period, which will be in approximately 22,5h for Moonbeam and less than 3h for Moonriver.

Thank you for your contributions to the MB ecosystem! Very much appreciated!  ![:heart_hands:](https://forum.moonbeam.network/images/emoji/twitter/heart_hands.png?v=12 ":heart_hands:")
