RadiumBlock RPC and Bootnode Services for Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase-alpha for Q4 2024/Q1 2025

**Abstract**  -  [RadiumBlock](https://www.radiumblock.com/)’s proposal seeks funding to provide high-performance RPC endpoints and bootnodes for the Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase-alpha networks for Q4 2024 and Q1 2025. RadiumBlock will deliver enterprise-grade infrastructure, supporting essential RPC methods, guaranteeing adherence to Moonbeam’s Code of Conduct, and ensuring fast, reliable, and scalable access for developers.

**Motivation**  - The Moonbeam Community, via the Treasury Council, should support this proposal to enhance the stability and growth of the Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase-alpha ecosystems. RadiumBlock’s services reduce the complexity of infrastructure management, allowing developers to focus on innovation. Additionally, providing blockchain snapshots  _(which we will set up within 30 days of proposal approval)_  will enable developers to quickly and efficiently access specific points in the network’s state, reducing synchronization time and further accelerating development. We believe this proposal will contribute to the long-term success and sustainability of the entire ecosystem by ensuring reliable, scalable infrastructure and enhanced developer tools.

**Project Overview and Team Experience**  - RadiumBlock, owned by RealWeb LLC, brings extensive experience in AWS infrastructure management and blockchain services. Since 2021, RadiumBlock has been an active and known participant in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem, participating in the Polkadot and Kusama Thousand Validator Program and offering validator services to several other chains. As active infrastructure provider in the DotSama ecosystem, RadiumBlock delivers RPC endpoints to over  [20 networks](https://radiumblock.com/supported-networks.html). The team’s proven track record includes providing  [essential snapshot services](https://radiumblock.com/snapshots.html)  and demonstrating capability to handle complex blockchain infrastructure needs.

For this proposal, RadiumBlock will deploy and maintain RPC endpoints and bootnodes for Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase-aplha ensuring near-100% uptime, scalability, and security. Leveraging a hybrid-model infrastructure (more on this in the  [full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1umspoMkWUSm03lyigVcxO_mGjCbdt6nLidE4R4iKbwk/edit?usp=sharing)) that combines on-premise bare-metal servers with cloud resources, RadiumBlock can effectively manage traffic surges and ensure low latency. This model also provides flexibility in deployment options (OnPrem, Cloud, or Hybrid), ensuring that the infrastructure remains robust and adaptable to varying demands. Additionally, we will also deploy Snapshots for Moonbeam and Moonriver within 30 days of approval of the proposal.

RadiumBlock’s infrastructure is designed with security as a top priority, implementing advanced encryption protocols, continuous monitoring, and automated failover mechanisms to protect the network and maintain service continuity. Additionally, the strategically located nodes and advanced load-balancing techniques contribute to exceptional speed and performance, ensuring that developers on the Moonbeam network can rely on fast, responsive, and secure access to the blockchain. With 24/7 technical support and a global presence, RadiumBlock is well-equipped to support the Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase-alpha ecosystems, enabling them to scale and thrive.

**Network Usage and Performance Statistics**  
To provide a clearer and more detailed understanding of the impact of RadiumBlock’s services on the Moonbeam and Moonriver networks, we have compiled key usage statistics (May 31 - August 28, 2024; 90 days):

-   Total Requests Served (Moonbeam + Moonriver): 8,209,772,365  
    Average Daily Requests on Moonbeam: 44,043,403.52  
    Average Daily Requests on Moonriver: 47,176,289.42  
    Peak Daily Requests on Moonbeam: 241,231,861  
    Peak Daily Requests on Moonriver: 612,830,371  
    Regions Covered: Europe, Asia, North America, Australia, South America, Africa

A more detailed breakdown of the usage statistics and requests across regions is provided in the  [full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1umspoMkWUSm03lyigVcxO_mGjCbdt6nLidE4R4iKbwk/edit?usp=sharing).

**Rationale**  - RadiumBlock’s proposal ensures that the Moonbeam Ecosystem has the reliable, scalable infrastructure needed to support its growth. By providing fast and secure  _RPC endpoints, bootnodes, and snapshots_, developers can build and deploy dApps more efficiently, while users benefit from improved speed, performance, and reliability.

**Overall Cost**  - The total cost for providing RPC endpoints and bootnodes for the Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase-alpha networks during Q4 2024 and Q1 2025 is $15,600. The breakdown is as follows:

-   Total Monthly Cost: $2,600
-   Total Cost for Q4 2024 and Q1 2025: $15,600
-   Cost Distribution:
-   60% allocated to Moonbeam (GLMR): $9,360 / 55,747.68 GLMR
-   40% allocated to Moonriver (MOVR): $6,240 / 704.11 MOVR

**Use of Treasury Funds**  - The requested treasury funds of $15,600 will be used primarily to cover the infrastructure costs associated with providing and maintaining high-performance RPC endpoints and bootnodes for the Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase-alpha networks during Q4 2024 and Q1 2025. This is all inclusive of operating and administrative expenses for server operations, our team’s ongoing support, monitoring, and security measures to ensure the network’s reliability, scalability, and security.

**Milestones:**

-   RPC Endpoints: already running for Moonbeam and Moonriver, will set up for Moonbase-alpha once the proposal is approved
-   Bootnodes: will set up for Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase-alpha once the proposal is approved
-   Snapshots: will be set up within 30 days once the proposal is approved (this does not incur additional cost)

_Footnote_  - Please refer to the  [full proposal document available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1umspoMkWUSm03lyigVcxO_mGjCbdt6nLidE4R4iKbwk/edit?usp=sharing)  for a detailed overview of the infrastructure design, service introduction, milestones, and RadiumBlock’s contributions to the ecosystem, supported by relevant usage statistics.

Dear  [@Abhayan_RadiumBlock](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/abhayan_radiumblock),

The  [@TreasuryCouncil](https://forum.moonbeam.network/groups/treasurycouncil)  would like to thank you for submitting the above RPC service proposal!

I am starting here a round of questions / feedback, other Treasury members could join afterwards.

With reference to your proposal my question is specifically about these points you reported in the proposal:

“ * RPC Endpoints: already running for Moonbeam and Moonriver, will set up for Moonbase-alpha once the proposal is approved

-   Bootnodes: will set up for Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase-alpha once the proposal is approved
-   Snapshots: will be set up within 30 days once the proposal is approved (this does not incur additional cost)"

1.  Extension to Moonbase-alpha: any forecast on the required timings to put it in place once proposal is (eventually) approved?
2.  30d to set-up Snapshots feature: can you consider a reduced timing here? If yes, how much?

To stay on schedule we’d appreciate a reply in a timely manner, ideally by next Monday, September 9th.

Thanks & kind regards  
Michele

Hi  [@Abhayan_RadiumBlock](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/abhayan_radiumblock)  , the Treasury Council has carefully reviewed your proposal and, considering your key strengths in decentralization, availability, and cost/quality balance, we are pleased to inform you that you are among the three RPC providers selected for Q4 2024 / Q1 2025. This post serves as your first Support Signal, with two more to follow soon. Additionally, the 30-day moving average price information will be provided to help you create your on-chain proposal.  
Your proposal was one of the most cost-effective options and performed exceptionally well across nearly all other categories. The only areas for possible improvement were the absence of trace+API and limited engagement within the community, particularly in ecosystem initiatives and discussions. That being said, we hope to see the team actively engage in conversations here on the Forum and across our socials moving forward!

Sorry, one more question - what is the max requests per second for the public endpoints? (this is for our documentation on moonbeam.network).

Hey  [@aaron.mbf](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/aaron.mbf),

We do not impose a strict limit on public endpoints per user. But for documentation purposes, let’s say we handle 200 requests per second. We dynamically adjust this threshold for security and DDoS reasons, allowing us to scale to practically 1000 requests per second  _or more as needed_  (basically unlimited). Please let me know if you need any other information from us.

To clarify, this proposal does not include running infrastructure for the Moonbase Alpha TestNet. According to the proposal, they will be provided once it is approved.

Please make sure to add them to our documentation by creating a commit in this specific table →  [moonbeam-docs/.snippets/text/builders/get-started/endpoints/moonbase.md at master · moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam-docs · GitHub](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam-docs/blob/master/.snippets/text/builders/get-started/endpoints/moonbase.md)

Hello  [@AlbertoV19](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/albertov19),

We are adding the endpoints for Moonbase-alpha, and we will update once it’s done.

Warmly,

This is to give an update;

1.  We have set up the snapshots for Moonbeam and Moonriver and they can be found at;

They are currently in RocksDB format. Michele had asked if we could set this up in ParityDb as well. Our team has already started this process. It takes roughly 7-14 days to sync the nodes and fully set up the weekly snapshots. I will update it here once they are done.

2.  The Moonbase-Alpha RPC is also ready.

Dear  [@Abhayan_RadiumBlock](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/abhayan_radiumblock)  ,

Please proceed with submitting your Treasury Proposal for the RPC services Q1 2025 payout on-chain. As before, please split the agreed quarterly cost in a 60/40 ratio between GLMR and MOVR using the EMA30 prices below.

GLMR: $ 0.265  
MOVR: $ 13.716

As per today’s Subscan data (provided by Coingecko) for  [MOVR](https://moonriver.subscan.io/tools/price_converter?value=1&type=time&from=MOVR&to=USD&time=1736463600)  and  
[GLMR](https://moonbeam.subscan.io/tools/price_converter?value=1&type=time&from=GLMR&to=USD&time=1736463600).

Once on-chain, we will make sure the Proposal is converted to a Council Motion and payed out asap.

Thank you so much!  
Yaron

Hey RadiumBlock - please hold off from submitting treasury proposals right now.  
With runtime 3300 the treasury.propose extrinsic was somehow removed rendering it unable to submit a spending proposal directly to the treasury (which is required to transform it into a motion by the treasury council).

We’ll keep you posted and sorry for the inconvenience and delays caused by this.  ![:pray:](https://forum.moonbeam.network/images/emoji/twitter/pray.png?v=12 ":pray:")

Hey  [@dev0_sik](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/dev0_sik),

We understand.  
Thanks for letting us know. We’ll hold off on posting the on-chain proposal until we receive further notice/updates from you.

Cheers,

Hey  [@Abhayan_RadiumBlock](https://forum.moonbeam.network/u/abhayan_radiumblock)

RT3401 is now enacted on both Moonbeam and Moonriver and the Treasury Council is ready to conduct your awaited payouts via the new  [Treasury Proposal flow](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/runtime-rt3400-schedule/1954/6).

For that matter, please provide us with a beneficiary address of your choice and the Treasury Council will process your proposal asap.

We’ve captured the EMA30 price for MOVR at $ 8.483093 at block  [10380992](https://moonriver.subscan.io/tools/price_converter?value=1&type=block&from=MOVR&to=USD&time=10380992)  and at $ 0.150840 at  [9673865](https://moonbeam.subscan.io/tools/price_converter?value=1&type=block&from=GLMR&to=USD&time=9673865)  for GLMR.

This will result in a total payout of 62,052.51 GLMR and 735.58 MOVR to settle your request of $ 15,600.

Again, thanks you for your patience!  
yaron
