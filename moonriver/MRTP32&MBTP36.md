Abstract

This proposal aims to secure funding to continue supporting the Moonbeam Multisig project, which is a fork of Safe that maintains the same UX/UI while incorporating integrations specific to the Moonbeam ecosystem.

Our service support proposal focuses on ensuring continuous operation, addressing any situation requiring personalized attention, such as incidents, bugs, research, dApp support, and community engagement. Additionally, we will continue working on new integrations.

We also commit to being ready for the rollout of new versions of Safe’s Smart Contracts (v1.4.0 and beyond), followed by ongoing support and the integration of new technologies.

All tokens received through this grant will be exclusively dedicated to covering infrastructure costs (Amazon AWS), proportional costs for subscriptions used by the solution (Coingecko, Sentry, and any other necessary services), compensating Protofire, and distributing tokens among developers involved in this support service (base compensation + performance-based bonuses).

Motivation

Moonbeam Multisig is a fork of Safe, which is well known as the most trusted platform to store digital assets on EVM due to its programmability. We consider this project a successful case where community users, DAOs and DeFi projects trust and use it to safely store assets and interact with Smart Contracts which directly supports TVL growth and would keep benefiting the Moonbeam community.

Project Overview and Team Experience

As the upstream Safe codebase is being constantly updated and changed by the Safe team, new releases need to be merged making sure it is updated and compatible with the Moonbeam Multisig instance.

Regular Safe updates will be performed and released on Moonbeam networks (Moonbeam, Moonriver and Moonbase). Updates consider Frontend (mainly user experience improvements), Backend services and Smart Contract.

Optimization also includes research and implementation of such features as Safe dApps, Modules, Guards, External Wallets Connectors, and customizations according to community needs.

Our team is a combination of management and development skills:

Strategic Leader: Ivan.

Project Manager: Eduardo.

Software Architect: Nick.

Blockchain Engineers: Marta, Nikita, Den, and Leoni.

DevOps Engineers: Leonid, and Ilya.

QA Engineer: Anton.

Protofire DAO team:

Worked as part of the Gnosis team on delivery of web and desktop versions of Gnosis Safe.

Delivered Gnosis Safe Apps (such as Compound, Synthetix Mintr Safe App, designed ENS Manager).

Created a devkit to improve the synchronization of the code in the Gnosis DApps.

Is a Gnosis Chain and Gnosis Beacon Chain validator.

Have been deploying and maintaining Safe instances over 30 chains such as: Evmos, Astar, Scroll, Mantle, Linea, Cronos, Holesky, Neon EVM, Rootstock to name a few.

Is an active member of the Safe community (Safe Guardians); we use our power to contribute positively to the ecosystem, aligning with Safe vision to drive the adoption of smart contract wallets.

Rationale

Moonbeam Multisig adds value to the ecosystem in the following ways:

Gives the community a trusted custody option for asset management. Safe smart contracts have passed the highest possible security standards in the industry including Formal Verification. Check it out.

Allows Protocols to deploy and interact with smart contracts in a secure manner which attracts top protocols, increases adoption and TVL.

Moonbeam Multisig attracts high-net-worth individuals, companies, holders, funds, developers, DAOs, and investors due to its reputation and programmability.

By allowing multiple signers to approve transactions, Moonbeam Multisig fosters decentralized decision-making, which aligns with the core principles of blockchain technology. This enables organizations and DAOs to manage funds and execute decisions in a more democratic and transparent manner.

Moonbeam Multisig is highly customizable, allowing users to set different rules and thresholds for transactions. This flexibility supports a wide range of use cases, from personal wallets to complex organizational structures, thereby adding versatility to blockchain operations.

Key Terms

Multisig (Multisignature): A key feature of the Safe Wallet, requiring multiple private keys (signers) to authorize a transaction, enhancing security and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
Safe Modules/Guards: Extensions that add custom functionalities to the Safe Wallet or restrict its basic functionality, allowing users to tailor the wallet to their specific needs, such as adding new approval mechanisms or integrating with other services.
Threshold: The minimum number of approvals required to execute a transaction from the Safe Wallet. This threshold can be adjusted based on the security needs of the users.
Overall Cost

We are transitioning our support model from a Time & Materials (T&M) approach to a more flexible support-as-a-service model. With the team expansion and our new service model, which allows us to operate based on priorities regardless of approved budget, we have managed to reduce monthly costs by approximately 40% compared to the previous grant (1st semester 2024).

We are requesting funds to cover the current semester, the second half of 2024, from July (last months: we have temporarily assigned the balance as an expense) through December.

Requested Funds: $27,000 (equivalent in GLMR and MOVR tokens considering conversion rate*).

*conversion rate will be set as the 30-day twap (time-weighted average price).

Use of Treasury Funds

Treasury Funds with potentially 25% allocated exclusively to infrastructure costs, and 75% covering the team, support areas (legal, finance, HR), and bonuses for members who achieve outstanding performance/feedback in the Moonbeam Multisig context.

Infra Costs $1000.00
Safe Support as a Service “$3,500.00”
Total “$4,500.00”

ECS Safe microservices 63%
CloudWatch “Logs, metrics and alarms” 12%
RDS Safe database 10%

|Other (ELB, WAF, ElastiCache, Route53, S3, CodePipeline, ECR, Lambda)|Load balancing, security, cache, dns, static files, deployment pipelines, docker images repository, monitoring functions)|15%|

% infra-costs

Safe as a Service includes:

Safe Updates: Regular Safe updates will be performed and released on the supported networks (Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase). Updates consider Frontend (mainly user experience improvements), Backend services and Smart Contract.

Safe Features: Research and implementation of features like Safe dApps, Safe Modules, Safe Guards, External Wallets Connectors, client customization, etc.

Infrastructure Support & Monitoring: DevOps support and monitoring, covering all aspects of infrastructure security, architecture optimization, monitoring and CI/CD pipeline enhancement in order to improve cost-effectiveness and scalability.

General Support: General support is provided to Moonbeam community, business, and technical teams considering incidents analysis and troubleshooting, research, and general inquiries.
