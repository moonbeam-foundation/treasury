# OnFinality High Performance Public Infrastructure (Nov - Dec 2022)

**Abstract**  - Ongoing costs for the running of high performance, scalable, and reliable public infrastructure for the Moonriver network from 1st November 2022 until 31st December 2022 (2 months).

**Motivation**  - Setting up blockchain infrastructure is difficult, time consuming, and expensive. A shared node API service helps mitigate these barriers of entry to trying accessing a new protocol by reducing all these costs to near zero. In summary, we try to reduce the pain of getting started on the Moonbeam Networks and minimise the costs of accessing secure nodes while traffic from your dApp is low.

**Project Overview and Team Experience**  -  [OnFinality](https://onfinality.io/)  is a SaaS platform providing infrastructure services for the Polkadot/Substrate community. Our mission is to support all blockchain developers in the world by providing core infrastructure so they can focus on building the next dApp.

**Overall Cost**  - We've created two proposals to cover the combined running costs for our infrastructure - one for Moonriver network and one for both  [Moonbeam and Moonbase Alpha Networks](https://moonbeam.polkassembly.network/treasury/6). The total outstanding costs for these networks are 1,638.3401 MOVR and 55,154.2135 GLMR respectively.

**Note:**  there is a significant  **reduction in monthly costs**  as a result of our efforts to drive down costs while maintaining performance and reliability. We did this through advanced caching strategies, advanced request method routing and working with our ecosystem partners to implement advanced rate limiting (meaning we can continue to provide generous public API endpoints but restrict access to high volume users that abuse this free service).

**Use of Treasury Funds**  - All funds will be used to pay for resources and infrastructure used to provide the service during November to December 2022
