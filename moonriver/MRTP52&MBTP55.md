We request funding to operate and continuously improve the Moonbeam Multisig (a Safe‑based fork) across Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase during  **July 1, 2025 – December 31, 2025**. Scope includes production operations (infra, monitoring, incident response), upstream Safe updates, ecosystem integrations, user support, and reliability/security improvements.

Previous semester  [proposal](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-mbxx-mrxx-moonbeam-multisig-support-and-optimization-services-for-moonbeam-moonriver-and-moonbase-for-1st-semester-2025/1998), Status: approved.

Moonbeam Multisig is the well known secure custody and coordination keystone for DAOs, teams, and protocols on Moonbeam networks. Sustained operations translate directly into  **safe asset management, executable governance, and protocol integrations**. Funding this proposal ensures:

-   **Continuity:**  extended hours availability and rapid incident response.
    
-   **Upgrades:**  Timely merges of upstream Safe releases and security patches.
    
-   **Ecosystem fit:**  New dApp integrations that unlock more on‑chain activity and TVL.

**What we run:**  a production‑grade fork of Safe (frontend, Transaction Service/backends, smart contracts, infra, and monitoring) purpose‑tuned for Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase. We handle deployments, staging-first pipeline and rolling production releases, observability, end user and teams support.

-   Gives the community a trusted custody option for asset management. Safe smart contracts have passed the highest possible security standards in the industry including Formal Verification.
    
-   Allows Protocols to deploy and interact with smart contracts in a secure manner which attracts top protocols, increases adoption and TVL.
    
-   Moonbeam Multisig attracts high-net-worth individuals, companies, holders, funds, developers, DAOs, and investors due to its reputation and programability.
    
-   By allowing multiple signers to approve transactions, Moonbeam Multisig fosters decentralized decision-making, which aligns with the core principles of blockchain technology. This enables organizations and DAOs to manage funds and execute decisions in a more democratic and transparent manner.
    
-   Moonbeam Multisig is highly customizable, allowing users to set different rules and thresholds for transactions. This flexibility supports a wide range of use cases, from personal wallets to complex organizational structures, thereby adding versatility to blockchain operations.

-   **Transaction Service (TxS):**  Indexer/API used by Safe frontends to surface multisig state and queue.
